# Game Of Life

## Rant
This is my take on Conway`s Game Of Life, written in C# - language ugly and weirdly pleasing at the same time. Please mind, that I am completely new to C#, thus I would except this implementation to be broken in many ways.


## How to run
```
$ cd game_of_life
$ dotnet run
```
